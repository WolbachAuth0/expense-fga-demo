# About this Project

This application demonstrates user authentication and fine grained authorization:

Authentication
- Logging in to Auth0 using Redirect Mode
- Accessing profile information that has been provided in the ID token

Authorization
- Gated content. The `/profile` route is not accessible without having first logged in
- Fine Grained Authentication. User's can only approve expense reports for their subordinates


## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).

## What is Okta Fine Grained Authentication?

Fine Grained Authorization (FGA) is Okta's [Fine-Grained Authorization](https://docs.fga.dev/intro/authorization-and-okta-fga#what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga) at scale SaaS based on Google's [Zanzibar](https://docs.fga.dev/intro/authorization-and-okta-fga#what-is-zanzibar). As of this writing (Feb 2024), it is currently under development. It is designed to make it easy for application builders to easily add fine-grained authorization to their apps. It offers an HTTP API and has SDKs for programming languages like Node.js/JavaScript and GoLang. More languages and also policy languages like Rego are planned for the future. It is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale. For latency and compliance reasons weâ€™ll have environments per jurisdiction (e.g. US, EU, AU) and also global clusters for applications that have a global user base.
